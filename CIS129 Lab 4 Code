#The company wants a program to modify their bonus portion to include different levels
# and types and eliminate the day off program
#program Description as follows:
#A retail company assigns a $6,000 store bonus if monthly sales are more than $110,000;
#  else if monthly sales are greater than or equal to $100,000 the store bonus is $5,000,
#  else if monthly sales are greater than or equal to $90,000 the store bonus is $4,000,
#  else if monthly sales are greater than or equal to $80,000, the store bonus is $3,000 
# otherwise a $0 amount or no store bonus is awarded.  They are using a percent of sales 
# increase to determine if employees get individual bonuses.  If sales increased by an amount 
# greater than or equal to 5% (0.05) then all employees get $75, else if sales increased by an 
# amount greater than or equal to 4%, employees get $50, else if sales increased by an amount 
# greater than or equal to 3% employees get $40 otherwise they get $0.
